This site documents common tooling we use in Python projects at the [Advanced Research Computing center](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/arc/) (ARC) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

It is not a comprehensive guide to everything out there, but intended as a forum to share knowledge across projects.
Each page contains a table of packages or services that are useful when building a Python package.
Each entry has a link to the package or service, and a short summary of what it does.

## Choosing tools
If you are working within a larger community, always start with the same tools they recommend - as an example, the `napari` project has a cookiecutter for setting up a new pacakge.
This makes it easier for others in the community to contribute to your package.

Otherwise, each page on this site highlights recommended solutions for each area.
These shouldn't be taken as set in stone for every project, but form a good place to start using technologies and packages that others in ARC have experience using.
