This site documents common tooling we use in Python projects at the [Advanced Research Computing center](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/arc/) (ARC) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

It is not comprehensive, but intended as a forum to share knowledge across projects.
Each page contains a table of packages or services that are useful when building a Python package.
Each entry has a link to the package or service, and a short summary of what it does.

## Choosing tools
If you are working within a larger community, always start with the same tools they recommend - as an example, the [`napari`](https://napari.org/) community have  [`cookiecutter-napari-plugin`](https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin) for setting up a new pacakge.
This makes it easier for others in the community to contribute to your package, and once you get used to the structure makes it easier for you to contribute back to other packages.

Otherwise, each page on this site highlights recommended pacakges or services for each area.
These shouldn't be taken as set in stone for every project, but are a good place to start.
