| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------: |
| conda-forge [miniforge] | Installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. Uses `conda`, but with community maintained packages from `conda-forge` channel instead of commercially maintained packages.                                                                                                                     | <span class="label label-green">Best</span>  |
| [uv]                    | Fast dependency (and project) management tool. A drop-in replacement for `venv`. This will probably become our <span class="label label-green">Best</span> tool, but for now we are playing cautious as there are some open bugs and features. If you're comfortable using `venv` syntax we'd recommend this. | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |
| [pipenv]                | Automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |
| [pixi]                  | A fast drop-in replacement for `conda`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |
| [pyenv]                 | Lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |
| [virtualenv]            | Creates isolated Python environments, and offers more features than venv.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |
| [venv]                  | Creates isolated Python environments. Fewer features than other tools, but widely used and comes built into Python.                                                                                                                                                                                           | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |
| [anaconda]              | Due to recent [licensing ambiguity][anaconda-problems], we recommend avoiding anaconda and many of the default channels. We recommend installing miniforge and sticking to the `conda-forge` channel.                                                                                                         |  <span class="label label-red">Avoid</span>  |
