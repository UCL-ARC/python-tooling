## General packaging

A common question facing developers is "_How much code should go into a
package?_". Where code to solve a research problem might be large and perform
several tasks at once typically one should try to stick to a mantra of doing one
thing well. The following questions can be helpful when trying to abide by this
mantra:

- What do I want my package to provide?
- How will users interact with or use the code in my package?
- Is everything I'm including in the package relevant or useful in supporting
  it's main purpose?

In Python, a [package](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#packages)
is a collection of one or more
[modules](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-module) to perform
software tasks. Typically there is a separate git repository per package, and we
recommend you stick to this. You can always add the packages as dependencies to
a higher-level package which is effectively the same, but much easier to reuse.

### Conda

These tools are helpful if you're looking to publish your package on
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), so users can install it through the
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/) package manager.
