# Documentation

With Python, as with many other languages, it's very common to automatically
create a web page with documentation. This can include reference for the API
taken from your package's [docstrings], tutorials, examples, and more in depth
explanation about how the package works. For an in-depth discussion of the
different components of good documentation, see the
[Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). For your package to be easily
reusable we recommend you build documentation pages and host them somewhere.

If you're using GitHub, one option is to host your docs on [GitHub pages].
[Here's how we've set this up][template-docs-dot-yaml] for [our template].

## Documentation build tools

| Name      | Short description                                                                                                                                               | 🚦  |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-: |
| [MkDocs]  | Generates documentation from Markdown files, with a plugin to generate API documentation. A good plugin ecosystem and balance of usability and customisability. | 🟢  |
| [Sphinx]  | Generates documentation from reStructuredText or Markdown files, long been the de-facto standard and very widely used. Mature plugin ecosystem.                 | 🟠  |
| [gitbook] | General documentation builder; integrates with GitHub.                                                                                                          | 🟠  |
| [pdoc]    | Auto-generates API documentation from docstrings, beginner friendly but with less of a plugin ecosystem than others.                                            | 🟠  |

<details markdown="block">
<summary>More details about Sphinx</summary>

We marginally recommend [MkDocs] over [Sphinx] due to it's ease of use,
preference for Markdown, and more support for a variety of docstring styles.

However the [Sphinx] tool has long been the de-facto standard in the scientific
Python ecosystem. It is widely used, customisable, and well tested. If you need
a [Sphinx extension](#sphinx-extensions) that does not have an equivalent
[MkDocs plugin](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog), or if you are part of a
community that heavily uses [Sphinx] then we recommend you use that instead.
