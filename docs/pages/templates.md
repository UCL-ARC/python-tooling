# Package templates

## Recommended ARC template

This [UCL-ARC/python-tooling](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/python-tooling) repository contains our recommended package template for new ARC projects.
It pre-configures the recommended tools listed in the other pages of this site.
If you're making a package within one of the communities listed below, we recommend using their template instead.

## Domain specific templates

These templates are used by specific communities.
If you're making a package within one of these communities, we recommend using their package template.
