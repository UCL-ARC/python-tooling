## Recommended libraries

Python has a large ecosystem of packages and modules beyond what is built in to Python.
Here is a list of libraries and toolkits that we've used in our projects, and can recommend (or might recommend that you avoid!).

The libraries listed here are not really "tooling" in the sense that some projects will need some of the functionalities here, but it is project-dependent, so we don't include any of these in [our template](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/python-tooling/blob/main/README.md#using-this-template).
If you need some functionality discussed in this list, it's good practice to add the package to your project's dependencies list.
To test it out, simply `pip install` into your enviroment and follow the package's "Getting Started" docs.
