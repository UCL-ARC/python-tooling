# Community building

There are many platforms to build a community for users and developers.
We recommend you choose one, and not more than one.
If you are creating a new space, you should consider joining an existing community space.
Common topics discussed in these communities can be developers meetings, ideas for new directions, and general help and support for users.

For projects with UCL, any University of London, and UCL-ARC collaborators we have the [Research Programming Hub](ucl-programming-hub.slack.com) Slack channel.
Any member of ARC can create a project channel. Note, however, the limitation for external collaborators.
