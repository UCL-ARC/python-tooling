for some of these.

### Code formatting

| Name                                                    | Short description                                                                                                                                                                                     |                      ðŸš¦                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------: |
| [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)                   | Universal tool which performs a git hook on commit, allows you to run linters/formatters on any code. A tool to automatically run many of the tools listed below.                                     | <span class="label label-green">Best</span>  |
| [ruff-format](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)        | A drop-in replacement for `black` (and also super fast). A nice "no-need to think" code formatter. If you have your own opinions about code style, you might not like this.                           | <span class="label label-green">Best</span>  |
| [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)               | A fast linter which incorporates a range of other linters. Notably [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) can be included as a [ruff rule](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) (which we recommend). | <span class="label label-green">Best</span>  |
| [toml-sort](https://github.com/pappasam/toml-sort)      | Sorts TOML files which are now part of PEP 8.                                                                                                                                                         | <span class="label label-green">Best</span>  |
| [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8)          | Formatter which conforms to PEP 8.                                                                                                                                                                    | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |
| [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)        | Opinionated formatter, defaults to 88 characters per line. Widely used, but we now recommend `ruff-format` in its place.                                                                              | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |
| [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)                 | Sorts imports alphabetically, splits into first/third party, works on python & cython code. We recommend this, but it can be included in `ruff`, which is simpler.                                    | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |

| [sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/)                        | An AI code reviewer which simplifies code, has a free version but can pay for fancier features.                                                                                                       | <span class="label label-yellow">Good</span> |

| [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)           | Linter which complains if code doesn't follow a rule.
