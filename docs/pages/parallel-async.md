# Parallel and asynchronous processing

Python has a good ecosystem of libraries for multiprocessing (threads and GPU
parallelisation), as well as asynchronous processing.

ðŸŸ  tools in the following may be preferred over ðŸŸ¢, if there are external
reasons to use a specific interface or parallelisation scheme. Possibly due to
the nature of the research problem, the high-performance computing resources
available or simply due to pre-existing code using a library like [pandas].

## Thread- and process-based parallelism

| Name              | Short description                                                                                                                                                                                            | ðŸš¦  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-: |
| [multiprocess]    | A fork of [multiprocessing] which uses `dill` instead of `pickle` to allow serializing wider range of object types including nested / anonymous functions. We've found this rather more simple to work with. | ðŸŸ¢  |
| [dask]            | Aims to make scaling existing code in familiar libraries (`numpy`, [pandas], `scikit-learn`, ...) easy.                                                                                                      | ðŸŸ   |
| [multiprocessing] | The standard library module for distributing tasks across multiple processes                                                                                                                                 | ðŸŸ   |
| [mpi4py]          | support for MPI based parallelism                                                                                                                                                                            | ðŸŸ   |

## Compiler-based parallelism
