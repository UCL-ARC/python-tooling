# python-tooling
This repository documents common tooling we use in our Python projects in the Advanced Research Computing center (ARC) at UCL.
It is designed as a static GitHub pages site.

1. Create a new branch.
2. Modify an existing page, or create a new one.
3. Open a pull request with changes.
4. Someone who did not contribute to the PR should review it.
5. If approved, the reviewer should merge the PR.
6. If changes requested, the PR author should address the comments, then ask for review again.
