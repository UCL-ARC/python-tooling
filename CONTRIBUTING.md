## Development workflow

To contribute a change, please:

1. Create a new branch (or fork if you're not in [@UCL-ARC/collaborations]).
2. Modify an existing page, create a new one, or tweak the template. a. Run
   [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) which will lint your changes. b. Check
   the tests pass if you modified the template (`pytest -s`).
3. Open a _pull request_ (PR) with changes.
4. Ask someone who did not contribute to the PR from [@UCL-ARC/collaborations]
   to review it.
5. If approved with no comments, then the reviewer will merge the PR.
6. If changes are requested, the PR author should address the comments, and then
   ask for review again.
